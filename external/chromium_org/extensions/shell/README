# Introduction

app_shell is an experimental project to build a minimal environment like
content_shell.

The goal is to be able to run a v2 app and supply most of the chrome.* extension
APIs without running the rest of Chrome.

app_shell is only officially supported on Chrome OS.

# How to run

$ app_shell --app-shell-app-path=/path/to/extension

# For example, you can try the calculator app:

$ app_shell --app-shell-app-path=chrome/common/extensions/docs/examples/apps/calculator/app/
